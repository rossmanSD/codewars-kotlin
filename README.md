# Introduction
My collection of Kata in Kotlin from CodeWars. You can find me to CodeWars [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/rossmansd). Originally a Java developer, I've been using Kotlin for Android development for a little over a year at the time of this writing, and I'm using the periodic Kata to help learn about writing more idiomatic Kotlin. It's easy to fall into familiar coding patterns learned from long ago.

# Testing
Every Kata is written more or less TDD style using simple unit tests written leveraging the [Kotest](https://kotest.io/) test framework. I'm using this opportunity to learn about it, so expect the tests to be overly simple at first.
